Hex Editor is a simple tool for editing EXEs, ROMs and more. More information can be found on MORE_INFO.txt.
I didn't put much information because this is a very simple tool and I don't think anyone would really use it, I just uploaded it because i had nothing else anymore to do with it.
You can use it for ROM hacking although i wouldn't really recommend it because hexadecimal is really low level and can feel really weird. I would probably make a better one to edit .EXE files and visualize stuff (instead of text) but for now thats all.

IMPORTANT:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To edit a byte put the "Offset" value to the byte address and put the "New Byte" to the new byte you change. Editing visualy (using the *text*) would not save.
The *text* is used *ONLY* for visualization.
